* TODO Sails on Rails [0/2]
** Problem
As currently designed KSP seems to run Kepler orbits when a spacecraft
is not active.  Is there a way to keep the sail propagator running in
the background to allow command profiles to complete? This would use
extra CPU. May want a notification when the sequence is completed.
