* DONE Save current throttle and Isp to other variables
* DONE During timewarp, perturb orbit and mass based on saved throttle and Isp [3/3]
** DONE Perturb orbit
** DONE Perturb mass
** DONE Perturb other resources (e.g. energy)
* DONE Look up energy consumption
* DONE Look up mass consumption
* DONE Format thrust in more readable form [3/3]
** DONE mN when < 1 N
** DONE N when < 1000 N
** DONE kN when < 1000000 N
* DONE Drop out of timewarp on depletion of any resource
* DONE Scale energy to more realistic amount
* DONE Show resource consumption
* TODO Bug: At time warps >= 100X, energy use doesn't balance with sample craft
** Sample craft: 1 ion engine, 2 gigantor XL solar arrays, Z-200 battery
** 5% throttle
** At 100x and 1000x, batteries a little low
** At 1000x, batteries ~50%
** At max warp, batteries deplete, but vessel doesn't shutdown
* TODO Test if this works for multiple engines and sails [0/2]
** TODO Multiple engines
** TODO Multiple sails
