* PersistentThrust
A plugin for [[http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com][Kerbal Space Program]] to allow low thrust propulsion
systems like ion engines and solar sails to operate during time warp.

** Requirements
- [[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-6-%28Jan-6%29][ModuleManager]]

** What works
- Continuous thrust engines and solar sail continue thrusting during realtime and timewarp
- Continuous thrust engine propellant mass and other resources depleted during timewarp
- Continuous thrust engine throttle stays set from realtime to timewarp and back

** What doesn't work
- Continuous thrust engine throttle and sail attitude can't be changed during timewarp

** Navigation
A companion project is under development to plan and preview low
thrust trajectories by scheduling attitude and throttle maneuvers. See
[[http://github.com/bld/SolarSailNavigator][SolarSailNavigator]] for the current version, which supports solar
sails.
